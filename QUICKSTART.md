# Quick Start Guide

## First Time Setup

1. **Mount your PSP** (via USB)
   ```bash
   # Your PSP should appear as /media/psp or /mnt/psp
   # Verify the MUSIC folder exists
   ls /mnt/psp/MUSIC
   ```

2. **Index your music library**
   ```bash
   ./psp_playlist_maker scan /mnt/psp/MUSIC
   ```
   This creates a `music_index.db` file with all your tracks.

3. **Launch the GUI**
   ```bash
   ./psp_playlist_maker gui
   ```

## Creating Your First Playlist

2. Type a playlist name (e.g., "Road Trip Mix")
3. Click **"‚ûï Create"**
4. Click on your new playlist to select it (it will highlight)
5. Browse through Artists ‚Üí Albums ‚Üí Songs
6. Click **"‚ûï"** next to any song to add it
7. When finished, click **"üíæ Export"** next to your playlist

## Tips

- **Album Art**: Requires internet connection. Fetched automatically when viewing track details.
- **Multiple Playlists**: Create different playlists for different moods!
- **Fast Browsing**: Click albums directly - only songs load when album is selected for better performance
- **Re-scan**: Run the scan command again if you add new music to your PSP

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see any music?**
- Make sure you ran the `scan` command first
- Check that music files are in `/MUSIC/<artist>/<album>/` structure

**Playlist doesn't work on PSP?**
- Ensure the `.m3u8` file is in the MUSIC folder (not in a subfolder)
- Check that song paths in the playlist match your actual file structure

**GUI won't start?**
- Make sure you built with `--release` for best performance
- Check you have display/graphics drivers installed

## Advanced
